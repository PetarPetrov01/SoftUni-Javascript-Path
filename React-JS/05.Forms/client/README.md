## Latest updates
* Implement sorting
    * Delegated onClick event listener -> 
    the function reads e.target.textContent ->
    Using state, if ascending, make descending else the opposite ->
    pases the query to the userService and sets the new state sorted.

* Controlled search input
    * The search input has an onChange event listener which sets the value through a state
    * If the value's length is greater than 0, the clear button shows up

* Implement search
    * The search form has an onSubmit Event listener which invokes the onSearch function
    * The onSearch function, collects the data from the input and checks if criteria is selected.
    * If the criteria is selected, an API call is made through the userService, additionaly passing the criteria and search info as query.
    * If the response is intact, sets the filtered useres in the state, causing prerender.

* Refactor create/edit component to make the form controlled. 
    * Calling the useState hook to store the form values in a state
    * Each input now has an onChange event listener which invokes the onChangeHandler 
    * onChangeHandler function sets the form values in the state
    * Each input uses the formState to set its value 
    * In the case of Editing (passing an user object to the component), useEffect is used to set formValues state with the passed user object.

* Implement Create/Edit form validation
    * Each input has an onBlur event listener, which maps through an object of the target.names and returns the error message


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
